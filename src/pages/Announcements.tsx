            <p className="text-text-mid leading-relaxed">
              We are proud to introduce our new Seafarer Parcel Pickup Service, a practical and innovative solution designed to meet a real need.
            </p>
            
            <p className="text-text-mid leading-relaxed">
              For many seafarers, accessing personal items while at sea or in port can be difficult. Limited time ashore, unfamiliar environments, and logistical barriers often make even simple deliveries a challenge.This new service changes that.
            </p>
            
            <p className="text-text-mid leading-relaxed font-medium text-navy">
              Through our platform, seafarers can:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 text-text-mid">
              <li>Ship personal items directly to a Mission to Seafarers Canada stations</li>
              <li>Access essential goods safely and reliably while in port</li>
              <li>Experience greater comfort and convenience during their journey</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p className="text-text-mid leading-relaxed mt-4">
              Once a parcel is delivered to a station, our team ensures it is securely received and ready for pickup when the seafarer arrives. It is a simple process, but one that makes a meaningful difference.
            </p>

            <p className="text-text-mid leading-relaxed font-medium text-navy mt-4">
              For our stations, this initiative:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 text-text-mid">
              <li>Strengthens service delivery</li>
              <li>Creates new opportunities for engagement</li>
              <li>Enhances the overall seafarer experience</li>
            </ul>

            <p className="text-text-mid leading-relaxed mt-4">
              As we approach the International Day of the Seafarer on June 25, this launch represents exactly what our mission stands for. Meeting seafarers where they are, with care that matters.

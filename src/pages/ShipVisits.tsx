A chaplain boards a vessel, greets the crew, and spends time in conversation. But what happens in those moments is far more powerful than it appears."

              <p className="text-text-mid text-lg leading-relaxed">
                Every visit begins with preparation. Before stepping on board, Dan reviews a full vessel briefing. This includes key details about the ship, its journey, and its crew. At first, it may seem routine, but this information becomes essential. It allows Dan to connect in a way that is personal, relevant, and meaningful.

                As Dan stepped aboard, he was warmly welcomed by the crew. They offered him coffee. In return, he offered chocolate. It was a small exchange, but it immediately created a sense of comfort and familiarity. That is where the visit truly began.

              Seated in the crew lounge, the conversation unfolded naturally. It moved from global events and ongoing conflicts to life on board, the realities of work, and the long journeys at sea. Soon, the tone shifted. The crew began sharing photos of their families, stories of their children’s graduations, and memories from past vacations. The conversation was not forced. It flowed.

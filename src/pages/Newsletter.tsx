              Port of Toronto: A Harbour of Trade, A Place of Care, A New Chapter Begins

              <p>
                Most people never think about the Port of Toronto. Yet every day, it quietly keeps Canada moving. 
                Ships arrive carrying the goods that shape daily life, materials for our cities, food for our tables, 
                and supplies that fuel entire industries. Like ports around the world, it is part of a global system 
                where around 80 to 90 percent of global trade by volume is transported by sea.
              </p>
              <p>
                But beyond cargo and commerce, the Port of Toronto is also a place of people. Every vessel carries 
                seafarers, individuals who spend months at sea, far from home, working long hours in often isolating 
                conditions. For many, arriving in port is one of the few opportunities to rest, reconnect with loved 
                ones, and access support on land.

                For over six decades, Mission to Seafarers Canada has been part of that story in Toronto. Through 
                the Mission to Seafarers Southern Ontario, the organization has supported seafarers since the early 
                1960s, offering something simple, yet powerful: a place of welcome.

                Ontario continues to strengthen its impact across ports in the region, ensuring that care for 
                seafarers remains consistent, coordinated, and deeply human.

                At the heart of this work is Judith Alltree, a leader whose impact has shaped seafarer welfare

                during the COVID-19 pandemic, her leadership reflects decades of commitment to those who are often

                In 2019, the Mission’s physical presence in the port was lost following a devastating flood. 
                For seven years, the work continued, but without a place to gather, something was missing. 
                Because for seafarers, space matters. A place to sit. A place to call home. A place to simply be.

                At our Thunder Bay station, Ed Swayze, Senior Chaplain, understands this deeply. His work is not

                and the dedicated volunteers who stand beside him. Whether it is coordinating ship visits, offering 
                support, or simply being present, volunteers extend the reach of care far beyond what one person 
                could do.

                supported, prepared, and empowered to serve effectively. Because when volunteers are equipped, the 
                impact multiplies.

                To every volunteer across our network, we say this clearly. Thank you for your time. Thank you for 
                your compassion. Because of you, a seafarer stepping off a ship in an unfamiliar port does not feel 
                alone. They feel welcomed.

                As we continue to grow across Canada, our commitment remains the same. To invest in our volunteers. 
                To support their leadership. And to recognize that behind every act of care is a person who has 
                chosen to give their time to others.
